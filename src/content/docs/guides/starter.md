You are welcome to use the search box at the top to search for a specific title or on the left sidebar we have the titles broken out by department. If you do not find the title you are looking for it may be because A) we dont have it yet or B) it may be too specific/niche. In either case you are welcome to submit a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/eajr/jobdescriptions-fyi) to request one be generated for you _or_ add your own to the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/eajr/jobdescriptions-fyi) by forking the repo and submitted a PR.

Note that these job descriptions are a launching board for you and you probably should tailor it a bit to be aligned with your organization.

In case anyone is wondering, that cute avatar on the homepage is also AI generated ;)
