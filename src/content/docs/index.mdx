## Next steps

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Start from a good foundation" icon="pencil">
    Hate being asked to write up a job description every time a new position
    opens? Or how about trying to find that JD you wrote last year somewhere in
    Dropbox or OneDrive? Use these job descriptions as mostly a complete
    foundation and make a few small tweaks to make it your own!
  </Card>
  <Card title="Completely open source" icon="add-document">
    Anyone is allowed to post a job description on this site by using the main
    project repository hosted on
    [GitHub](https://github.com/eajr/jobdescriptions-fyi). Fork the project, add
    your job description, and submit a Pull Request. It won't take long till
    your change is merged and available for the world!
  </Card>
  <Card title="License & attribution free" icon="setting">
    All job descriptions are under [MIT
    license](https://opensource.org/license/mit). Use it without any changes, or
    make as many changes as you want. Even this Astro app is open source and
    under the same license so feel free to fork and host your own version!
  </Card>
  <Card title="Request more descriptions" icon="open-book">
    Submit a new [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/eajr/jobdescriptions-fyi)
    with the "Request JD" label and someone will get it generated for you!
